## 1. Project Objectives

* Collect affiliate data in a relevant time period.
* Compare performances based on sound statistical tests.
* Display results in an easy-to-read application.
* Suggest rate adjustments to maximize revenues.

## 2. Resources / Tools

* Google BigQuery (SQL)
* Python
* Pandas
* Plotly
* Dash
* Docker

## 3. Data Collection

* Collect last-7-days data with converted rates: [SQL Query](https://github.com/quentinb28/affiliate-performance-app/blob/main/src/query_sql.py)
* Load data from BigQuery to Dataframe: [Get Data](https://github.com/quentinb28/affiliate-performance-app/blob/main/src/get_data.py)

## 4. Statistical Test

* Filter unbalanced delivery (Daily Impressions / Click-Through Rates)
* Pick control brand based on cumulated effective Cost Per Mile (eCPM).
* Run ChiSquare Test for Independance on conversion rate between variant and control (Leads / Impressions).
* Suggest relevant rate based on test results:
  * Significant Difference: Variant Rate * eCPM uplift
  * Not Significant Difference: Control Rate (if Control Rate > Variant Rate)
